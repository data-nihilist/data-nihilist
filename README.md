Hi ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif)My name is Matthew McCredy
=======================================================================================================================================

Full-Stack Web Developer || RN App Developer
---------------------------------------------
#### Why Am I Here?

- I first learned programming while farming full time. I'm fascinated with alchemizing natural processes into functioning programs that enrich the lives of those using them.
- My friends and I began diving into making video games, and what's cooler than being the cool uncle that brings fun games during the holidays? Being the cool uncle that makes video games.

#### What I Want

- To build cool tools for cool people; My definition of 'cool' is pretty straight forward: You give a damn.
- To continuously improve, be it work related or otherwise.

#### Where I Work

Currently I'm a front end developer for New York, New York's GoodBread Inc.

- You can still find me on the community slack channel for <a href="https://featrix.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Featrix [Boston, MA]</a>, my first seat on the front end. Some say my comments still litter the dark corridors leading to the AI model's chamber..
- I had the honor of creating a website for and in collaboration with <a href="https://www.softethix.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">SoftEthix</a>, the game developers behind their current project inspire me daily.

What I enjoy most about programming is its fundamentally collaborative nature. I learn the most when I'm surrounded by others who enjoy that nature as much as I do.
So far I've been spoiled by the engineers I consider my mentors, and I'm eager to return the favors they've given me.

#### What I Enjoy About My Work

- Building tools for people that want to improve the lives of others.
- Having my code torn to pieces by someone who could bring down a database with a single `-curl` command
- Rinse. Repeat.

#### What I Want To Work On

- AirBnB's Polyglot
- D&D Homebrew Map Generator
- AgTech (before/while beginning web development, I was a full time farmer)
- DSA learning program for my niece and nephew
