Hi ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif)My name is Matthew McCredy
=======================================================================================================================================

Full-Stack Web Developer
-----------------------------------
#### Why Am I Here?

- I first learned programming while farming full time. I'm fascinated with alchemizing natural processes into functioning programs that enrich the lives of those using them.
- My friends and I began diving into making video games, and what's cooler than being the cool uncle that brings fun games during the holidays? Being the cool uncle that makes video games.
- I feel like I've finally found my nich√®!

#### What I Want

- To build cool tools for cool people; My definition of 'cool' is pretty straight forward: You give a damn.
- To continuously improve, be it work related or otherwise

#### Where I Work

- You can see some of my work if you visit the SoftEthix.io website - this has since been taken over by a handful of NY based artists. Gotta love 'em.
- Featrix: If you're a developer that wants to use AI to clean your dirty data and begin working asap, this is the platform for you.
- GoodBread: Currently targetting our MVP date in late Fall of 2024 - we're changing the way small businesses gain access to equity.

I'm always happy to collaborate or figure out the right approach to something. I'm constantly learning. Feel free to drop a follow or send a request to either of the links below!
